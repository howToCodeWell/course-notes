To copy a file from your local machine into the container run the following

```bash
$ docker cp <CONTAINER_NAME>:<SRC_PATH> <DEST_PATH>
```

- `<CONTAINER_NAME>` is the name or ID of the container
- `<SRC_PATH>` is the source of the file on your local machine
- `<DEST_PATH>` is the destination where the file/folder will go
