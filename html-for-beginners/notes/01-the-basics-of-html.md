HTML is the cornerstone of the web.  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the markup language of the internet.  
In this tutorial we will go over the fundamentals of Hyper Text Markup (HTML). During this tutorial I will discuss the difference between HTML and other languages such as Python and JavaScript we also cover the history of HTML.
In this tutorial I demonstrate the following HTML elements and declarations.

## Doctypes

A HTML document must start with a doctype element as this tells the browser what type of document to expect. It's important to remember that a HTML doctype isn't a HTML tag but a declaration.
This is a Doctype declaration
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## Head tag

The documents head element contains metadata about the HTML document. This metadata is not displayed but used by the browser to link to other resources, define encoding, define SEO attributes and perform other meta related tasks . 
This is a head tag.
```html
<head>
    <!-- Place meta elements here -->
</head>
```

## Body tag
```html
<body>
    <!-- Place body elements here -->
</body>
```

## Heading tags

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
```

## Paragraph tags
This is a paragraph

```html
<p>This is a paragraph tag</p>
```

## Ordered lists

If you need an ordered list use the OL tag.

- List item one
- List item two
- List item three

```html
<oL>
   <li>List item one</li>
   <li>List item two</li>
   <li>List item three</li>
</ol>
```

## Un ordered lists

An un ordered list will structure list items without numbers like this

* List item one
* List item two
* List item two

```html
<ul>
   <li>List item one</li>
   <li>List item two</li>
   <li>List item three</li>
</ul>
```
