[00:00:00] Welcome to the fourth part of the HTML tutorial series. Today we're going to look at how we can format the text within a paragraph. Let's say we want to change the look and feel of the text within a paragraphs. So what I've done is I've created a blank tutorial file here.

[00:00:22] This is the browser on the right hand side. What I'm going to do is just jump into. This is the third tutorial. This is where we left off last time when we were looking at images. I'm just going to change the contents of this file and change this paragraph here.

[00:00:49] So this tutorial demonstrates how to alter the text within HTML. Okay. Right now, what I'm going to do is just remove the contents of this paragraph. I'm going to leave these bits in here and save that now.  Let's refresh the page and see what we have. Okay. So what we can do is change the look and feel of some of these tags.

[00:01:24] We can make these bold and we can emphasize the text. Let's go and change some bits and pieces in here. Let's say we want to make the word within this paragraph more important than the other words more make it come across more stronger and there is a HTML markup we can use which is strong. This basically is what this is doing. It is telling the browser when it's rendering this page that the contents of this tag has more importance over the other tags. Therefore the contents of the stron tag becomes bold in typeface.

[00:02:15] Let's save that and refresh the page. And then we go see, this is, this tutorial demonstrates how to alter that text and HTML. The word tutorial here is in bold. And that's because we have this. Uh, strong it's wrapped around these strong tanks. Now, um, another thing we can do is emphasize, um, some texts within this, this paragraph, and we do that by using the E M tag.

[00:02:42] Now, previously we were using the eye tag and that basically makes it into Italax. Let's go and change it. The word, excuse me, alter or I tell what let's use HTML. Let's do E M.

[00:03:02] Like, so let's save that now and let's refresh the page. Okay. So now we have a HTML in a taluks it's been emphasized. That's what the M stands for. And we have the tutorial in bold. Now, other things we can do, we could perhaps, um, Uh, if we're reviewing this content, we might want to strike through some, uh, some text.

[00:03:24] Let's say we want to strike through the word alter and we, right. We use the, um, uh, mark-up, which is, uh, strike. Oops, like that. And then we closed that off here.

[00:03:44] And save that. Now what that's going to do is it should, yeah, it should add a strike through over the word alter. Um, and let's go and add some text here. Let's let's instead of use the word alter, let's just use the word change and perhaps we want to, um, uh, ensure that the word change replaces the word alter.

[00:04:04] Maybe if we're reviewing this document and in doing that, we could use the, you. Um, uh, mockup and you is underlying. Okay. So let's run, refresh this, and now we can see that we have an underlined change. Okay. So that that's, um, that's, uh, uh, uh, So a couple of ways to change the way the text looks and feels within the paragraph.

[00:04:32] Um, but this, this line of text is getting pretty long. What happens if you've got some texts that is already pre formatted and you want to keep the formatting of that text? Let's uh, let's do an example. So P. To open up paragraph and I'm just going to have, this is a long, um, paragraph, um, uh, blah, blah.

[00:05:10] Don't pick your text. All right. Okay. Let's just save that and refresh to make sure it's there. And let's go and copy that again and put this in a second time. Let's change this from P to a tag called pre now pre is pre formatted text. Now on the off, you will notice that the font has actually changed.

[00:05:39] Let's save that and run that. Whoops. There we go, you'll see that this has actually changed, uh, in, in font. It's actually a different, completely different front to how it is up there. Also notice that we have this huge gap here now that is because we have this big gap. Like, so if I was to, uh, put all this up in one line like that and save this.

[00:06:08] Um, it becomes inline. So what's happened there. Well, pre formatted text is essentially basically what it sounds like it is text that is already formatted and, uh, the, the, the usual rules of creating, um, texts within paragraphs are removed when using pre formatted texts. Notice that this here has a, some space here and I can, yeah.

[00:06:33] What I can do is just move this along all the way up here and save that because it's in the P tags, it adheres to the rules of the P tag and therefore it already, it keeps putting it on the left-hand side. However, if we were to space this out in the same manner, let's move this to, to here. And then. Down like that.

[00:06:57] So it's in this, it's the same setup as the P  tag. It behaves very differently. Let's refresh the page because it's, it's adopting the, um, the spaces that I've put in here, the tabs that I have to put in here. And that is because it's seeing this as formatted. Now we can go a bit further. We can also just, um, putting some blank lines

[00:07:21] and save that. Refresh. And we now have these blank lines, like, so if I was to do that with this, so this is a, and then a space move that all the way over here in is a, a long bit of text. There we go. So I'm just making sure it's the same setup as this pre Taglit save that. And, um, refresh nothing happens.

[00:07:51] And the reason why is because it is in the paragraph, um, HTML C uh, or the browser sees the para anything in the paragraph [00:08:00] as, um, as a section of text in its own. Right. And therefore, any, uh, internal formatting that has happened that isn't within. These are the fine markup tags get removed. So this is, this actually returns a single line of text.

[00:08:17] Whereas this. Is broken up because it's already, it's pre formatted. It's winning within the pre formatted, um, tags. This is very useful for things like writing code, um, or just right. Or, or writing examples of things that you need to adopt your pre formatted text, um, to it. Excuse me. Okay. What I'm going to do just to tidy up is I'm going to just save this here and I'm going to go into the index file and I'm just going to copy that and put in tutorial for tutorial for here.

[00:08:56] And I'm going to copy that line. I'm going to save that and we're going to paste it in here. And also in the third one, because I just want to keep this reference of, um, links of the pages. Um, so I'll also do it on the fourth one, too.

[00:09:24] Save that. So now we should refresh the page and we can go back to tutorial three tutorial, two and four and so on. Okay. So in the next tutorial, we're going to look at some other tags. Um, we can actually look at the table tag, um, and how we can create tables. So stay tuned for that. But in the meantime, if you've got any questions or comments, then.
